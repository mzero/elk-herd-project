----

`crunch/elk-herd` is an application for managing some Elektron musical instruments. It lets you:

* Manage samples on the +Drive of **Digitakt**, **Analog Rytm** (mk I and II), and **Model:Samples** instruments
* Manage the patterns, sample pool, and sound pool of **Digitakt** projects (in the coming 3.0 version)

## Running it

`crunch/elk-herd` runs in any browser that supports WebMIDI. This basically means Chrome. It will work on Linux, OS X, Windows, ChromeOS, and Android. It will not work on iOS (because Chrome uses the Safari engine there).

## F.A.Q.

* Is this an official Elektron thing? Nope! I did it on my own... please don't bother their tech support with issues. Report them here instead!
