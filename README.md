# elk-herd-project
The bug tracker and wiki for elk-herd, software for Elektron instruments

----

`crunch/elk-herd` is an application for managing some Elektron musical instruments. It lets you:

* Manage samples on the +Drive of **Digitakt**, **Analog Rytm** (mk I and II), and **Model:Samples** instruments
* Manage the patterns, sample pool, and sound pool of **Digitakt** projects (in the coming 3.0 version)

## Running it

`crunch/elk-herd` runs in any browser that supports WebMIDI. This basically means Chrome. It will work on Linux, OS X, Windows, ChromeOS, and Android. It will not work on iOS (because Chrome uses the Safari engine there).

## 3.0 Alpha

There is a public alpha release of 3.0 which has the **Digitakt** project managment features.

## Reporing Issues

Please report issues here, in this repo.

## F.A.Q.

* Is this an official Elektron thing? Nope! I did it on my own... please don't bother their tech support with issues. Report them here instead!

* Why do I see no code checked in here? Because the project is not currently open source.

* Why not? I had to work out the protocol to the synths on my own, as Elektron isn't ready to support it publically. I respect that, and don't want to make the protocol public by releasing my source code. Elektron is committed to eventually making an API they can support, and at that point I'll be happy to open my source.
